# Project-Archive
A collection of all my older games/side projects... Varying amounts of effort and polish whent into these projects so look at my code at your own discression.

**Invaders of Space** (Circa 2018):
- A game I made for the camp I taught at, the sprites are interchangeable so the students can create their own games.
- Heavily "inspired" by space invaders.

**The_Night** (Circa 2018):
- My Magnum Opus.
- Is a really bad 2.5D car doging game, with lives.
- Probably my best game!

**Pong(s)** (Circa 2018):
- A series of pongs, progressing in complexity for my ICS4U Class...
- Written in JavaScript with HTML and CSS front end.

**RPG_Game** (Circa 2018):
- A submission for my ICS4U class.
- Worked with graphs randomization and some pathfinding to make an adventure game.
- Has two whole minutes of gameplay!!!

**Pong Final** (Circa 2017)
- A final version of pong I submitted for my ICS3U Class.
- Is super sketchy, I would recommend skipping this one.
