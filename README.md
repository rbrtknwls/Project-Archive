# Project-Archive
A collection of all my older games/side projects:

Invaders of Space (Circa 2018):
- A game I made for the camp I taught at, the sprites are interchangable so the students can create their own games.
- Heavily "inspried" by space invaders.

Pong(s) (Circa 2018):
- A series of pongs, progressing in complexity for my ICS4U Class...
- Written in Java Script with html and css front end.


RPG_Game (Circa 2018):
- Final submission for my ICS4U class.
- Worked with graphs randomization and some pathfinding to make an adventure game.
- Has two whole minitues of gameplay!!!

Pong Final (Circa 2017)
- A final verison of pong I submitted for my ICS3U Class.
- Is super sketchy, I would recomend skipping this one.
